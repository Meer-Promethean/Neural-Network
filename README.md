# Practical Neural Network Implementation Assignment

In this assignment, you will implement a neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy. Your implementation should include all the necessary components for training on a sample dataset.

## Task 1: Basic Structure

1. Implement a `Neuron` class that represents a single neuron with weights, bias, and an activation function.
2. Create a `Layer` class that can hold multiple neurons.
3. Implement a `NeuralNetwork` class that can contain multiple layers.

## Task 2: Forward Propagation

4. Implement forward propagation for the `Neuron`, `Layer`, and `NeuralNetwork` classes.
5. Add support for different activation functions (at least ReLU and Sigmoid).

## Task 3: Loss Function

6. Implement a `LossFunction` class with loss functions:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  

## Task 4: Backpropagation

7. Implement the backpropagation algorithm for your neural network.
8. Ensure that gradients are correctly calculated and propagated through the network.

## Task 5: Optimization

9. Implement a simple optimizer (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent) to update weights and biases.
10. Add support for different learning rates.

## Task 6: Training Loop

11. Create a training loop that can:
    - Perform forward propagation
    - Calculate loss
    - Perform backpropagation
    - Update weights and biases
12. Implement a method to track and display training progress (e.g., loss over epochs).

## Task 7: Evaluation

13. Implement methods to evaluate the model's performance on a test set.
14. Add support for different evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks).

## Task 8: Sample Dataset

15. Generate or load a simple dataset Spiral dataset
16. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Task 9: Training and Testing

17. Train your neural network on the training set.
